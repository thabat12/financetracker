<i>Learn Personal Financee & Track Your Money.</i>

## What is BitFinance?

Our goal is to make personal finance easy for anyone and empower individuals to learn and become better at managing their money. In order to achieve these goals, personal finance needs to become easy to understand, fun to learn, and encourage personal growth. BitFinance is an app that aims to provide users with the perfect product to achieve all these goals.

## Getting Started

#### backend
All the backend logic is located in `backend`. In the broadest scope, the backend is currently a FastAPI server developed in a Python environment, and all its modules are containerized and prepped to run on AWS.


#### financetracker-app
The BitFinance mobile app and its codebase is all located in the `app` folder. The mobile app is a React Native codebase, which allows for ease of development for cross-platforms.


## Repository Details
This repository is hosted publically for the time-being, but eventually, we will have to make it private for security reasons when the app is actually live. Currently, we are still in the development phase.

## Updates
We are switching to native. React Native is too much of a hassle and for a performant app, native features are pretty much required.
